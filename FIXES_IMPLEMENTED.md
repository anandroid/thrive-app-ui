# Fixes Implemented

## 1. Hide Question Context from UI ✅

### Problem
The question context "(answering: "Have you tried any sleep supplements before?")" was visible to users in the chat UI.

### Solution
Updated `SmartCardChat.tsx` to:
- Extract clean display message without context
- Show clean message in UI
- Send full message with context to API only

```javascript
// Extract display message and API message
const displayMessage = messageToSend.replace(/\s*\(answering: "[^"]+"\)\s*$/i, '').trim();
const apiMessage = messageToSend; // Full message with context for API

// Show clean message in UI
const userMessage: ChatMessage = {
  role: 'user',
  content: displayMessage, // Clean message for display
  timestamp: new Date()
};

// Send full context to API
body: JSON.stringify({
  message: apiMessage, // Full message with context
  threadId: chatThreadId || threadId,
  basicContext
})
```

### Result
- UI shows: "No"
- API receives: "No (answering: "Have you tried any sleep supplements before?")"

## 2. Assistant Acknowledgment Instructions Updated ✅

### Problem
The assistants weren't acknowledging user responses because the `create-assistant-team-simple.js` script had outdated hardcoded instructions.

### Solution
1. Added acknowledgment rules to the script's `COMMON_TEAM_INSTRUCTIONS`
2. Ran the script to update all three assistants

### Instructions Added:
```
### Conversation Flow
IMPORTANT: ALWAYS acknowledge user input before proceeding:
- Start responses with a brief acknowledgment of what the user just said
- Keep acknowledgments short and natural (2-10 words)
- Connect their input to your response with bridge phrases
- This applies to ALL user responses: yes/no answers, questions, statements, selections, or any other input

Examples:
- User: "No" → "I understand, no supplements yet..."
- User: "I wake up at 3am every night" → "Waking at 3am is frustrating..."
- User: "Not sure" → "That's perfectly fine..."
```

### Assistants Updated:
- ✅ Chat Specialist: asst_Y57IpjAUTYn2XSuCmS9uH5Cm
- ✅ Routine Specialist: asst_2A35siez0Fx9EvoIiH8PxagV  
- ✅ Pantry Specialist: asst_Arw5lYmKhDy9P1jVEodDKFC7

## Expected Behavior Now

### Before:
- User: "No"
- Assistant: "Great! Let's get started on building a routine..."

### After:
- User: "No" (UI shows this)
- API receives: "No (answering: "Have you tried any sleep supplements before?")"
- Assistant: "I see you haven't tried supplements yet. That's perfectly fine - let's start with natural sleep techniques..."

## Technical Notes

1. **UI/API Separation**: Clean separation between what users see and what the API processes
2. **Context Preservation**: Full question context sent to API for better understanding
3. **Acknowledgment Rules**: Now properly included in all assistant instructions
4. **No User Confusion**: Users won't see technical context annotations

## Testing
To verify these fixes work:
1. Ask a yes/no question in chat
2. Answer "No"
3. Check that:
   - UI shows just "No"
   - Assistant acknowledges the "No" response
   - Assistant provides contextual follow-up based on the question
