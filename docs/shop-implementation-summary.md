# Shop Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview
We've implemented a comprehensive vendor management and shop system for the Thrive app that supports both Thrive's own products (via Shopify) and affiliate products from partners like Amazon.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Database Schema (Firestore)
- **vendors** - Store vendor information (Thrive or affiliate partners)
- **products** - Product catalog with support for both product types
- **categories** - Product category hierarchy
- **affiliate_clicks** - Track affiliate link clicks for analytics
- **shop_settings** - Global shop configuration
- **user_favorites** - User's saved products

### Key Components

#### Admin Interface (`/admin`)
1. **Product Manager** - CRUD operations for products
2. **Vendor Manager** - Manage Thrive and affiliate vendors
3. **Analytics Dashboard** - View clicks, conversions, and revenue
4. **Shop Settings** - Configure banners, featured categories, and affiliate disclosure

#### Shop Frontend (`/shop`)
1. **Enhanced Shop** - New product grid with filtering and search
2. **Product Cards** - Conditional CTAs based on vendor type:
   - Thrive products ‚Üí "Add to Cart" button
   - Affiliate products ‚Üí "Buy from [Brand]" with external link
3. **Category Navigation** - Browse by wellness categories
4. **Affiliate Click Tracking** - Automatic tracking for commission reporting

## üîß API Endpoints
