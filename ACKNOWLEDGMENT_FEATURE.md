# Universal Input Acknowledgment Feature

## Overview
Implemented a universal acknowledgment system that ensures the AI assistant always acknowledges user input before proceeding with its response. This makes conversations feel more natural and ensures users feel heard.

## What Changed

### 1. Updated Common Instructions
Added to `/src/services/openai/assistant/team/commonInstructions.ts`:

```
### Conversation Flow
IMPORTANT: ALWAYS acknowledge user input before proceeding:
- Start responses with a brief acknowledgment of what the user just said
- Keep acknowledgments short and natural (2-10 words)
- Connect their input to your response with bridge phrases
- This applies to ALL user responses: yes/no answers, questions, statements, selections, or any other input

Examples:
- User: "No" → "I understand, no supplements yet..."
- User: "I wake up at 3am every night" → "Waking at 3am is frustrating..."
- User: "Not sure" → "That's perfectly fine..."
- User: selects option → "Great choice! Let's work with..."
```

### 2. Enhanced Context Cache
Updated `getStructuredContext()` to highlight the most recent user input:

```
MOST RECENT USER INPUT: "No" - You MUST acknowledge this before proceeding.
```

This ensures the assistant is explicitly reminded to acknowledge the latest user response.

## How It Works

1. **User sends any input** (yes/no, statement, question, selection)
2. **Context cache stores the message** and marks it as most recent
3. **Assistant receives context** with explicit reminder to acknowledge
4. **Assistant responds** starting with acknowledgment, then transitions to recommendation

## Examples

### Before:
- User: "No"
- Assistant: "Great! Let's get started on building a routine..."

### After:
- User: "No"
- Assistant: "I understand you haven't tried supplements yet. Let's start with natural sleep routines..."

### More Examples:
- User: "I'm stressed about work"
- Assistant: "Work stress can really impact wellness. Here are some techniques..."

- User: "Not sure"
- Assistant: "That's perfectly fine! Let me help you explore options..."

- User: "2-3 times a week"
- Assistant: "2-3 times weekly is a good starting point. We can build on that..."

## Benefits

1. **Natural Flow**: Conversations feel more human-like
2. **User Validation**: Users feel heard and understood
3. **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation continuity
4. **Universal Application**: Works for all types of user input
5. **Smooth Transitions**: Bridge phrases connect acknowledgment to recommendations

## Testing

Run the acknowledgment test:
```bash
node scripts/test-acknowledgment.js
```

Or test manually at `/test-context` to see acknowledgments in action.

## Technical Notes

- Acknowledgments are kept brief (2-10 words) to avoid being verbose
- The rule is in common instructions, so all specialists follow it
- Context cache explicitly highlights the most recent user input
- Works seamlessly with the sliding window context system
