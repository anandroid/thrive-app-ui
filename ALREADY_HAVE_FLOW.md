# "I Already Have It" Flow

## Overview
When the assistant recommends supplements, it now provides both options:
1. **"I already have [Supplement]"** - For users who own the supplement
2. **"Where to find [Supplement]"** - For users who need to purchase it

This approach is:
- **Non-pushy**: Doesn't pressure users to buy
- **Convenient**: Quick tracking for what they already have
- **Educational**: Focuses on proper usage and benefits

## User Experience Flow

### 1. User asks about health concern
```
User: "I want to sleep better"
```

### 2. Assistant provides balanced options
The assistant shows both buttons for each supplement:

```
üåô Magnesium for Relaxation
Take 200-400mg about 30-60 minutes before bed...

[‚ûï I already have Magnesium]  [üõí Where to find Magnesium]

üçµ L-Theanine for Calm Mind  
This amino acid promotes relaxation without drowsiness...

[‚ûï I already have L-Theanine]  [üõí Where to find L-Theanine]
```

### 3a. If user clicks "I already have it"
- Opens PantryAddModal with:
  - Pre-filled supplement name
  - Suggested dosage notes
  - Context message: "Great choice! Tracking this helps me personalize your sleep routine and remind you when to take it."
- User can add photo, adjust notes, and save
- After saving: Success message in chat

### 3b. If user clicks "Where to find it"
- Opens Amazon search in new tab
- Search is pre-configured with relevant terms
- User can shop and return to the app
- Can later click "I already have it" after purchasing

## Example Prompts That Trigger This Flow

- "I want to sleep better"
- "What can help with my anxiety?"
- "I have chronic pain, what supplements might help?"
- "How can I boost my immune system?"
- "What vitamins should I take for energy?"

The assistant will always provide both options, letting users choose what's most helpful for their situation.
