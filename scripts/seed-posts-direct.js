1. ðŸŒ… **Sunlight First Thing** - 10 minutes of morning sun helps regulate circadian rhythm
2. ðŸ’§ **Hydrate Before Coffee** - 16oz of water with lemon kickstarts metabolism
3. ðŸ§˜ **5-Minute Breathwork** - Simple box breathing reduces cortisol
4. ðŸ¥— **Protein-Rich Breakfast** - Stabilizes blood sugar for hours
5. ðŸ“± **Phone-Free First Hour** - Protects dopamine for sustained focus

The best part? This entire routine takes less than 30 minutes!

    title: 'My 30-Day Sleep Transformation Journey',
    body: `For years, I thought 5 hours of sleep was enough. "I'll sleep when I'm dead," right? Wrong. Here's what happened when I committed to 8 hours for 30 days:

Week 1: Honestly, it was hard. My mind raced at bedtime.
Week 2: Started using blue light filters. Game changer!
Week 3: Energy levels I haven't felt since college
Week 4: My focus at work improved dramatically

The biggest surprise? My anxiety decreased by what feels like 50%. I had no idea poor sleep was fueling my stress.

My sleep stack:
â€¢ Magnesium glycinate before bed
â€¢ Phone charging outside bedroom
â€¢ Blackout curtains
â€¢ 65Â°F room temperature

Anyone else prioritizing sleep? What's worked for you?`,

    title: 'Found My Perfect Stress-Relief Routine (It\'s Not What You Think)',
    body: `After trying everything - meditation apps, yoga, journaling - I finally found what works for me: cooking.

Specifically, Sunday meal prep has become my meditation. There's something about chopping vegetables, following recipes, and creating nourishing food that completely calms my mind.

My routine:
â€¢ Put on a podcast or music
â€¢ Prep 5 meals for the week
â€¢ Try one new recipe
â€¢ No phone calls or multitasking

The bonus? I eat healthier all week and save money. Win-win!

Sometimes the best wellness practices are hiding in plain sight. What unexpected activity helps you de-stress?`,
