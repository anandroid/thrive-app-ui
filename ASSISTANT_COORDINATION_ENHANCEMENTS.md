# Assistant Coordination Enhancements

## Date: 2025-07-11

### Summary
Enhanced the Thrive AI assistant team coordination to improve personalization and avoid generic routines. Implemented supplement-first protocol, added pain intensity tracking for journeys, and strengthened context sharing between assistants.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Chat Assistant Updates (`/src/services/openai/assistant/team/chatAssistant.ts`)
- Added **Supplement-First Protocol**: Chat assistant now recommends supplements BEFORE suggesting routine creation
- Ensures supplement recommendations always appear first in actionableItems array
- Updated triage protocol to recommend Routine Specialist AFTER supplement recommendations
- This ensures routines are personalized with specific supplements, not generic

### 2. Routine Assistant Updates (`/src/services/openai/assistant/team/routineAssistant.ts`)
- Added **No Generic Routines Policy**: Routines must be HIGHLY PERSONALIZED
- Enhanced context extraction to include specific supplements, medications, and exact symptoms
- Added requirements to incorporate user's accepted supplements into routine steps
- Emphasized using exact details from conversation, not placeholder content
- Added special handling for specialty conditions (chronic pain, autoimmune, etc.)

### 3. Routine Creation Context Enhancement (`/app/api/routine/create/route.ts`)
- Enhanced context extraction to specifically capture supplement recommendations
- Added parsing for supplement_choice and already_have action types
- Includes supplement names, dosages, and timing in conversation context
- Ensures routine creation has access to all supplement decisions

### 4. Routine Prompt Builder Updates (`/src/services/openai/routines/routinePromptBuilder.ts`)
- Updated prompts to emphasize supplement incorporation
- Added explicit requirements for including accepted supplements
- Enhanced system prompt to avoid generic "take your supplements" steps
- Requires specific supplement names, dosages, and timing

### 5. Pain Intensity Slider for Journeys (`/components/features/JourneyCreationModal.tsx`)
- Added pain intensity slider (0-10 scale) for pain management journeys
- Visual gradient from green (low pain) to red (high pain)
- Custom CSS styling for better mobile UX
- Pain intensity passed to API and incorporated into journey creation

### 6. Journey API Enhancement (`/app/api/journey/create/route.ts`)
- Added painIntensity parameter handling
- Contextualizes journey prompts based on pain severity (mild/moderate/severe)
- Ensures pain management strategies are appropriate for intensity level

### 7. Common Instructions Updates (`/src/services/openai/assistant/team/commonInstructions.ts`)
- Added **Supplement-First Protocol** as critical team coordination rule
- Enhanced **No Generic Responses Policy** with specific examples
- Improved context sharing requirements between assistants
- Added emphasis on using exact user words and symptoms

### 8. Submit Tool Outputs Fix (`/app/api/assistant/submit-tool-outputs/route.ts`)
- Fixed header consistency issues (quoted Connection key)
- Added X-Accel-Buffering header to all responses
- Ensures proper SSE streaming format

## Benefits

1. **Better Personalization**: Routines now incorporate specific supplements and exact user concerns
2. **Improved Coordination**: Clear supplement-first flow ensures continuity between chat and routine creation
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Pain intensity slider provides more nuanced journey creation
4. **Reduced Generic Content**: Strong policies against placeholder content ensure every routine feels custom
5. **Better Context Sharing**: Enhanced context extraction captures all relevant details from conversations

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test chat flow: User mentions health concern → supplements recommended → routine creation suggested
2. Verify routine creation includes specific supplements mentioned in chat
3. Test pain journey creation with different intensity levels
4. Ensure no generic routines for specialty conditions
5. Verify submit-tool-outputs streaming works properly

## Next Steps

1. Monitor assistant responses for generic content
2. Consider adding more condition-specific inputs (like pain intensity) for other journey types
3. Enhance context sharing to include user's daily schedule and preferences
4. Consider adding supplement interaction warnings in routine creation
