- If user mentions health issues and HAS relevant routines: ALWAYS suggest adjusting the existing routine with specific improvements
- If user asks about supplements they don't have in pantry: ALWAYS include "buy" actionable items with specific product details
- If user mentions buying supplements: ALWAYS suggest "add_to_pantry" actionable items
