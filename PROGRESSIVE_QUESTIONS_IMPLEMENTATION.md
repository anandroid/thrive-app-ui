# Progressive Questions Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete redesign of the questions UI with progressive disclosure and enhanced visual design.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Progressive Disclosure
- **One question at a time** - No more overwhelming users with all questions
- **Smooth transitions** - Slide-in animations between questions
- **Auto-advance** - Questions progress automatically after answering
- **Reduced cognitive load** - Users focus on one thing at a time

### 2. ✅ Visual Hierarchy
- **Yes button**: Green gradient (`from-emerald-500 to-emerald-600`) with hover scale
- **No button**: Gray gradient (`from-gray-300 to-gray-400`) neutral styling
- **Not sure**: Soft pink (`from-dusty-rose/30`), spans full width
- **Time options**: Clean borders with hover states and arrow icons

### 3. ✅ Better Spacing
- **24px between elements** - More breathing room
- **Padding increased** - 24px (p-6) on mobile, 32px (p-8) on desktop
- **Touch targets** - All buttons minimum 48px height (p-4)
- **Rounded corners** - Larger radius (rounded-2xl/3xl) for modern look

### 4. ✅ Progress Indicator
```
[●●●○○] Question 3 of 5
```
- Visual progress dots that expand when active
- Current question highlighted with larger dot
- Text indicator shows exact position
- Only shows when multiple questions

### 5. ✅ Improved Time Selection
- "Custom time" reveals inline time picker
- No navigation away from page
- Clear Cancel/Submit buttons
- Smooth slide-in animation for custom input

### 6. ✅ Micro-interactions
- **Slide-in animations** - Questions slide in from right
- **Hover transforms** - Buttons scale on hover (1.02-1.05)
- **Arrow animations** - Chevrons move on hover
- **Shadow effects** - Dynamic shadows on interaction
- **Gradient shifts** - Colors intensify on hover

### 7. ✅ Context Preservation
- **Answered questions collapsed** - Viewable on demand
- **Skip option** - "Skip remaining questions" with icon
- **Answer tracking** - Shows what user answered
- **Expandable history** - Click to view previous answers

## Technical Implementation

### Component Changes
- Complete rewrite of `EnhancedQuestions.tsx`
- State management for progressive flow
- Animation states for smooth transitions
- Separate handlers for each question type

### Visual Improvements
```css
/* Button heights - minimum 44px */
.button { 
  padding: 1rem; /* 16px = 48px total height */
  min-height: 44px;
}

/* Spacing between elements */
.question-container {
  gap: 1.5rem; /* 24px */
}

/* Card padding */
.question-card {
  padding: 1.5rem; /* 24px mobile */
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    padding: 2rem; /* 32px desktop */
  }
}
```

### Assistant Instructions Updated
- Chat assistant knows questions are progressive
- Instructed to limit to 3-5 questions max
- Emphasized making each question count
- Questions should be ordered by importance

## User Experience Flow

1. **User sees first question** with progress indicator
2. **Answers question** → Smooth transition to next
3. **Can skip remaining** if they want to continue
4. **View answered questions** collapsed at bottom
5. **Context preserved** in API calls
