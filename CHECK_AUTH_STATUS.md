# Authentication Status Check

Based on my analysis, your Firebase configuration is properly set up in the app. Here's what I found:

## ‚úÖ Configuration Status
- Firebase environment variables are correctly set in `.env.local`
- Auth providers (Phone, Google, Apple) are implemented in the code
- AuthContext is properly configured to handle user authentication

## üîç Things to Check in Your Browser

1. **Open Chrome DevTools Console** (Right-click ‚Üí Inspect ‚Üí Console tab)
2. **Look for these specific messages:**
   - Any Firebase initialization errors
   - reCAPTCHA errors
   - Network errors (401 Unauthorized)

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. reCAPTCHA Network Error (401 Unauthorized)
This is likely because `localhost:3000` needs to be authorized in Firebase.

**Solution:**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project: `thrive-dev-465922`
3. Go to **Authentication ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Authorized domains**
4. Add these domains:
   - `localhost`
   - `localhost:3000`
   - `127.0.0.1`
   - `127.0.0.1:3000`

### 2. Google/Apple Sign-In Popup Blocked
Browsers may block authentication popups.

**Solution:**
- Click the popup blocker icon in the address bar
- Allow popups for `localhost:3000`

### 3. Phone Authentication reCAPTCHA Issues
The 401 error suggests domain authorization issue.

**Additional Steps:**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials**
4. Find the reCAPTCHA key (auto-created by Firebase)
5. Click on it and add `localhost` to allowed domains

## üì± Testing Authentication

1. **Test Phone Auth:**
   - Click "Sign In" button
   - Enter phone number (with country code)
   - You should receive an SMS with verification code

2. **Test Google Sign-In:**
   - Click "Sign in with Google"
   - A popup should appear (ensure popups are allowed)
   - Sign in with your Google account

3. **Test Apple Sign-In:**
   - Click "Sign in with Apple"
   - Requires Apple ID with 2FA enabled

## üîÑ Quick Fix Steps

1. **Clear browser data:**
   ```
   Chrome ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Clear browsing data
   Select: Cookies and Cached images
   ```

2. **Test in Incognito/Private mode** to rule out extension conflicts

3. **Restart the dev server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

## üìä Expected Console Output

When everything works correctly, you should see:
```
Firebase initialized successfully
reCAPTCHA rendered
Auth state changed: [user object or null]
```
